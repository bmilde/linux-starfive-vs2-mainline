Linux kernel 6.10.0 for VisionFive 2 (JH-7110 SoC)
==================================================

This git contains a recent Linux kernel + patches for the VisionFive 2 Risc-V 64 bit SoC.

Forked from https://github.com/skif-web/linux-starfive-vs2-mainline (Thanks!!)
and merged with recent upstream changes from mainline. 

Among other things, PCI-E and USB are working now, see below :)

Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the reStructuredText markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
